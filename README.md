# Final-Project-JSCRIPT-330-B / Event Countdown Application

Proposal and Task Breakdown
1. Scenario:
The Event Countdown Application is designed to provide users with a platform where they can create and track countdowns to important events or deadlines. Whether it's an upcoming birthday, a project deadline, or a vacation, users can use this application to stay organized and keep track of how much time is left until their events occur.

2. Problem:
People often find it challenging to keep track of upcoming events or deadlines and accurately calculate the time remaining until they occur. Traditional methods such as using calendars or manual calculations may not always be convenient or effective. The Event Countdown Application seeks to solve this problem by providing users with a simple and intuitive platform to create, manage, and track countdowns to their events.

3. Technical Components:

Routes: The application will implement CRUD operations for countdowns, user authentication, and authorization.
Data Models: The data models will include entities for users and countdowns. User authentication will be managed using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication.
Search Functionality: The application will implement text search functionality to allow users to search for specific countdowns by event names, descriptions, or keywords. This feature will enhance the user experience by enabling quick and efficient retrieval of relevant countdowns.

4. Meeting Project Requirements:

Authentication and Authorization:
Users will be able to register, login, and authenticate to access the application securely.
Authorization will be implemented to ensure users can only manage their own countdowns.
CRUD Routes:
CRUD routes will be implemented for countdowns, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete countdowns. Additional CRUD routes will be implemented for categories, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete categories to organize their countdowns. Further routes will be implemented for user management, including registration, login, and profile update. 
Testing:
Thorough testing will be conducted for all routes using testing frameworks like Mocha and Chai.
Test coverage will be maintained at > 80% to ensure the reliability and stability of the application.
