# Final-Project-JSCRIPT-330-B / Event Countdown Application

Event Countdown Application - Self-Evaluation
Project Overview
The Event Countdown Application is designed to provide users with a platform where they can create and track countdowns to important events or deadlines. Whether it's an upcoming birthday, a project deadline, or a vacation, users can use this application to stay organized and keep track of how much time is left until their events occur.

Functional Evaluation
Features Implemented

User Authentication:

Users can register and log in.
Authentication tokens are used to secure API routes.

Dashboard:

The dashboard displays the nearest event with a live countdown clock.
Users can filter events by category.
Events are displayed with options to view and delete.
Events are sorted by the most pressing deadline.

Event Management:

Users can create new events with an optional category.
Events can be viewed in detail.
Users can change the category of an event.
Expired events are automatically handled.

Category Management:

Users can create, view, and delete categories.
Events can be categorized for better organization.
Notifications:

Notifications are displayed for actions such as event deletion.
Design and User Experience
The user interface provides a basic and functional design. Key areas include:

Personalized Welcome Message: Users are greeted with a personalized message on the dashboard.
Event Countdown Display: The most urgent event is highlighted with a countdown clock.
Category Filtering: Users can filter events by category, making it easier to manage and view relevant events.
Areas for Improvement
Design Enhancements:

The current design is functional but lacks visual appeal. A more polished and modern design could improve user experience.
Implementing a digital clock with a large, clear countdown display could enhance the visual aspect of the application.
User Flow:

When no events are present, the dashboard displays default placeholders. Redirecting new users to an introduction page with a tutorial could improve onboarding.
After deleting all events, users should be redirected to the introduction page to avoid displaying an empty dashboard.
Category Management:

Ensure smooth interaction when creating and deleting categories, avoiding issues such as failed deletions.
Technical Evaluation
Achievements
Authentication: Secure login and registration with token-based authentication.
CRUD Operations: Implemented CRUD operations for both events and categories.
Real-time Countdown: Implemented real-time countdown for the nearest event.
Notifications: Added user notifications for key actions.
Challenges
Testing: Unable to get the testing framework to work. This is a significant area for improvement as automated testing is crucial for maintaining application reliability.
Error Handling: Basic error handling is in place, but more comprehensive and user-friendly error messages could improve the user experience.
Overall Assessment
The Event Countdown Application meets the core requirements and provides a functional platform for managing and tracking events. However, there is room for improvement in both design and functionality. Future work should focus on enhancing the user interface, improving user flow, and implementing comprehensive testing to ensure application stability.

Conclusion
This project has provided a solid foundation for understanding full-stack development, including authentication, CRUD operations, and real-time data handling. The next steps should focus on refining the user experience and ensuring robust testing to support future development.
